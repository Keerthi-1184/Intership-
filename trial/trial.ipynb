Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; and try to prevent these health problems.&lt;/p&gt;What are the types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;There are different types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. If you have type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. This is the most common form of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. If you have type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. This is a form of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What causes &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The different types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; have different causes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers think type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers think gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Who is more likely to develop &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The different types of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; have different risk factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can develop type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; may increase your chance of developing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are at higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; if you:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are overweight or have obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are not physically active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are at higher risk of developing gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; if you:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are overweight or have obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; in a previous pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very thirsty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling very hungry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Urinating (peeing) more often, including at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurry vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sores that do not heal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing weight without trying&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The symptoms of type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; usually come on quickly and can be severe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;To find out if you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test.&lt;/p&gt;What are the treatments for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatment for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; involves managing your blood glucose levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicine that works with insulin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicines to manage their &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.&lt;/p&gt;Can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;Type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; can't be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be able to delay or prevent type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/p&gt;</content>\n",

Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well.

This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;Who is at risk for type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;You are at higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are over age 45.

If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst and urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased hunger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sores that do not heal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How is type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed?&lt;p&gt;Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. The blood tests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What are the treatments for type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Treatment for type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicine, if you take any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medicines for &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Can type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; be prevented?&lt;p&gt;You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/p&gt;</content>\n",

It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. Researchers think gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy, along with genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;Who is more likely to develop gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is pregnant could develop gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. But you are more likely to develop it if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are overweight or have obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; in a previous pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How do I know if I have gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;p&gt;Gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours.\n",

      "&lt;/p&gt;How can &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; affect my pregnancy?&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are more likely to develop preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are more likely to need a cesarean delivery, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan, physical activity routine, and/or medicines. If you have any &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; health problems, they may get worse during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your baby is more likely to be born early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;How can I manage &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; during pregnancy?&lt;p&gt;There are steps you can take to manage your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; before, during, and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant. High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicines are safe during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicines. It's also important that you:\n",
      "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get regular prenatal checkups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take your prenatal vitamins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you had gestational &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, you are at risk of developing type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you already had &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; management plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIH: National Institute of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt; and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/p&gt;</content>\n",

      "      <content name=\"FullSummary\">&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the common type of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; in children and teens was type 1. It was called juvenile &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. With Type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now younger people are also getting type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;.  Type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; used to be called adult-onset &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, the body does not make or use insulin well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children have a higher risk of type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; if they  are overweight or have obesity, have a family history of &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt;, or are not active. Children who are African American, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; in children:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have them maintain a healthy weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure they are physically active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit time with the TV, computer, and video&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and teens with type 1 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; may need to take insulin. Type 2 &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; may be  controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral &lt;span class=\"qt0\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/span&gt; medicines or insulin.

      "Title: The effect of therapeutic artistic activities on anxiety and psychological well-being in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a randomized controlled study.\n",
      "Abstract: A parallel-group, randomized controlled design was implemented in this study to examine the effectiveness of therapeutic art activities for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The study was conducted at Ankara Bilkent City Hospital between November 2023 and August 2024 with 72 adolescents aged 9-18 (36 intervention, 36 control). The intervention group participated in 6 weeks of therapeutic art activities, while the control group received standard care. Therapeutic artistic activities included Zentangle, mandala painting, third-person drawing techniques, and the awareness of four-leaf clover. Sessions were held one-on-one via WhatsApp. The State Anxiety Inventory and Psychological Well-Being Scale were administered at the beginning and end of the study. After the therapeutic program, the mean state anxiety score of adolescents in the intervention group (32.19 ± 2.75) was significantly lower than in the control group (45.13 ± 4.84). Additionally, at the end of the program, the mean psychological well-being score of adolescents in the intervention group (48.52 ± 5.30) was significantly higher than that of the control group (33.41 ± 9.83) (p < 0.05).\n",
      "It was concluded that therapeutic art activities were effective in reducing anxiety and improving psychological well-being in adolescents with diabetes. It is recommended that therapeutic art activities be integrated into the care programs for children with diabetes.\n",

      "Title: Treatment with crocin attenuates cardiac metabolic disturbances and subsequent inflammation in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.\n",
      "Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder closely associated with cardiac dysfunction. Natural products are considered potential candidates for the management of DM. Crocin, a natural carotenoid derived from saffron, has been reported to possess several pharmacological properties, including cardioprotective effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the beneficial effects of crocin on the metabolic derangement of the diabetic myocardium. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were treated with 10 mg/kg of crocin daily for two weeks. Oral administration of crocin normalized blood glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels. Notably, crocin reduced the elevated protein levels of cardiac PPARα and PPARδ-major transcriptional regulators of cardiac metabolism-back to normal. Consequently, the expression of the fatty acid (FA) transporter CD36 was downregulated, the activity of the FA oxidation enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was decreased, and intramyocardial triglyceride accumulation returned to physiological levels. Furthermore, crocin improved glucose uptake and metabolism in the diabetic myocardium, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, enhanced activity of pyruvate kinase, and downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Importantly, the stimulatory effect of crocin on Akt phosphorylation was also confirmed in isolated cardiac myocytes exposed to high glucose, further supporting its direct role in modulating glucose signaling pathways. Crocin treatment also reduced STZ-induced elevations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines-interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-as well as the phosphorylation of IκBα, bringing them close to basal levels. Overall, these findings suggest that crocin activates Akt signaling and thereby alleviates diabetes-induced metabolic disturbances by restoring the balance between glucose and fatty acid utilization in the hearts of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Therefore, crocin supplementation may represent a promising approach for the development of natural compound-based adjunct therapies for diabetic cardiomyopathy.\n",
