      "Abstract: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is widely recognized for its efficacy in treating diabetic wounds, but the mechanisms involved in the wound healing process remain unclear. By examining changes in blood cytokine levels as molecular signaling precursors, we aim to provide a comprehensive cytokine profile to support adjunctive therapy research and clinical applications. A diabetic mouse wound model was established to compare cytokine profiles between NPWT-treated and standard dressing groups...\n",

      "Authors: Yuting Yan, Xin Gao, Yi Zhang, Fan Xie, Lianzhong Ai\n",
      "Abstract: Highland barley is a low-glycemic-index grain, and its slow-digesting starch can help delay or prevent the onset and progression of type â…¡ diabetes. Peeling processes can alter the composition of highland barley, potentially changing its digestive properties. This study explored how changes in nutritional components due to different peeling times (zero, one, two, and three times) affected the digestion and absorption of barley during the gastric and intestinal phases and the utilization of undig...\n",

      "Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial retinal disease influenced by complex molecular mechanisms, including genetic susceptibility, inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation. While substantial progress has been made in understanding its pathogenesis, the full molecular underpinnings of AMD remain unclear, impeding the effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies. This study provides an in-depth exploration of the molecular interactions involved in AMD pr...\n",

      "Abstract: The term \"big data analytics (BDA)\" defines the computational techniques to study complex datasets that are too large for common data processing software, encompassing techniques such as data mining (DM), machine learning (ML), and predictive analytics (PA) to find patterns, correlations, and insights in massive datasets. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are attributed to a combination of various risk factors, including sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. We se...\n"
